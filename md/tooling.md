# Tooling

I didn't mention this earlier to avoid muddying the waters, but Reason is basically Ocaml with some syntax differences. This means that it can use much of the Ocaml toolchain for things like:

* editor integration via [Merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin)
* the great [Ocaml compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml)
* access to [Bucklescript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript)
