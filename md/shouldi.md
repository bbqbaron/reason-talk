## Use Reason In Prod?

Goodness no.

## Use Reason?

if you:

* want true type safety and ADTs in a full-stack language, but would get in trouble for using PureScript
* have always wanted to learn Ocaml but found the syntax alienating
* think that if Facebook is going to bless an ML language, you should definitely get while the getting's good
* are just kind of a nerd 8|=

## Not Use Reason?

if you:

* are smarter than I am and write code that just doesn't crash
  * just use Clojure
* are just writing UIs
  * Elm
* want to share your static code with a JVM backend
  * Kotlin
  * or perhaps ScalaJS
